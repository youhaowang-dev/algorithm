# dos and don'ts
* working solution first, then optimize
* no more no less
  * Design a working solution for our budget and expectation.
  * Don't design for bigger scale that does not exist.
* know tradeoffs
* ask questions before starting design
  * what features do we want to design in this meeting?
  * any availability, consistency requirement?
  * assume other system components have been built? For example user service already exists.

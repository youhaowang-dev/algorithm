# https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/
# A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

# Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index.
# If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

# You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always
# considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
# Output: 5
# Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

class FindPeakElement:

    # based on the assumption(-1 and len are max int), peak always exists

            if mid_val > mid_right_val:

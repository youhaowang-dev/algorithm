// Given a node in a binary search tree, return the in-order successor of that node in the BST. If that node has no in-order successor, return null.

// The successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than node.val.

// You will have direct access to the node but not to the root of the tree. Each node will have a reference to its parent node. Below is the definition for Node:

// class Node {
//     public int val;
//     public Node left;
//     public Node right;
//     public Node parent;
// }
class InorderSuccessorInBSTII {

  public Node inorderSuccessor(Node node) {}
}
